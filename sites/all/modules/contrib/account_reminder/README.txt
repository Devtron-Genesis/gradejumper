Account Reminder will resend the welcome email to those users who have registered but who have not yet logged into your site for the first time. The admin can control the initial time before sending a reminder, the time period between subsequent reminders and the total number of reminders to send. The email that is sent is also fully customizable.

3) Configuration of Account Reminder can be done at admin/settings/account_reminder.
