Redirect site visitors to another URL when Maintenance Mode is enabled.

The module adds two additional fields to the Maintenance Mode
configuration page (admin/config/development/maintenance). The checkbox is used
to enable URL redirect when the site is in Maintenance Mode. The Redirect URL
field should contain a URL to go to when the URL redirect is enabled.
